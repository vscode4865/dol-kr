	In charge, a scent hits your nose. It's familiar. Deer. Several of the pack members catch the scent too, looking over to you.

	In charge, you see tracks in the mud. Hooves, likely a deer. Pack members sniff at them, tails wagging in excitement.

You once again begin to run, this time with a target in mind.

You try to keep the pack uniform, remembering how the Black Wolf would lead. This is difficult, with older members trying to take over or the younger ones falling behind to play.
<br><br>
The pack makes it close enough to see the deer in the clearing. It seems to be on high alert, looking up frequently and eating little. Thankfully, you are all downwind, obscured by the brush.
<br><br>
The thought of taking it down still doesn't appease you. Instead, you pick a member with experience, who seems eager to take the role.
<br><br>
Pack members move into place before striking out. Panicked, the deer bolts, but the pack keeps up.

You just begin to catch your breath when excited yips and whines sound off. A scent has been found, the proper hunt beginning.

There seems to be further struggles for power as more wolves try to organise the pack. Some nip, some bark, some barge to ensure everyone stays together.
<br><br>
All sounds fall quiet when the pack gets in range of the deer. Downwind and hidden by the brush, you see as one <<wolf_cave_singular>> directs the others into place, ready to jump out at the prey.
<br><br>
The leader begins, starting at a slow trot. The deer bolts, and the chase begins anew.

You manage to keep up with the deer on its left side, further away than other pack members nipping at its ankles.
<br><br>
Weaving between the trees, you come ahead of the hunt. The deer is slowly being worn down, more and more wolves catching up to it.
<br><br>
It seems the hunt will be successful when the deer pushes with all of its might. Sharp teeth snap after it as the deer almost escapes their grasps.
<br><br>
Behind you the river roars over rapids, a fallen tree acting as a bridge. If the deer escapes and makes it across, the pack will go hungry.
<br><br>
You make it to the tree trunk. The chaos of the hunt grows louder behind you, the deer narrowly being caught again.

	After all of the running, your limbs strain and ache. Despite this, you are able to grit your teeth and roll the log until it splashes into the water.
	<br><br>
	A split second later, the deer bules, having escaped the pack only to stumble at the edge of the river bank. With nowhere to run, it tries to leap over the pack to run back to the clearing... <span class="green">it doesn't make it</span>.
	<br><br>
	The pack howls in excitement. It was a big catch, and they'll all be full tonight.
	<br><br>
	Hungry in your own right, you let your eyes wander. They land on a low apple tree, the fruit ripe and delicious.

	After all of the running, your limbs strain and ache. The ache is too much, you feel it too deeply, and a cramp begins to spread up your leg. You collapse to the ground before you can roll the log away.
	<br><br>
	The deer makes its final escape attempt, bounding over you and onto the log. A <<wolf_cave_singular>> goes to follow, but the fallen tree breaks in half just as the deer makes it to the other side.
	<br><br>
	The pack whines and howls, disappointed and hungry. They leave you alone soon after, still desperate for food. You eat well enough, grabbing the small rabbit for the Black Wolf to eat.

Not wanting to be part of the fight, you go looking for easier food. An apple tree stands a few metres away, you will be able to eat. You notice a rabbit caught in a hunter's trap as you forage.
