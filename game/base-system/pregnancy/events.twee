"복부에서 이상한 느낌이 들고 있다고?" <<he_ ga>> 묻는다. 당신은 끄덕인다. <<He_ nun>> <<his_ yi>> 의자를 가까이 끌어와, <<his_ yi>> 청진기를 당신의 배에 댄다.
<br><br>
<<He_ nun>> 잠시 동안 듣더니, <<his_ yi>> 컴푸터 쪽으로 의자를 끌고 가 무언가를 입력한다. "너는 기생충 문제를 앓고 있구나," <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "그 녀석들은 너를 그들의 생식 주기의 일부로 사용하고 있는 거란다." <<He_ nun>> 당신의 얼굴 표정을 알아채고 싱긋 웃는다. "걱정하지 마라. 그 녀석들은 너를 해치지는 못해. 그 녀석들은 때가 되면 네게서 빠져나갈 거란다."
<br><br>
<<He_ nun>> 몇 분 동안 그 생물체의 "탄생"이 어떻게 되는지에 대해 설명한다. 무엇을 하고, 무엇을 하지 않는지를. 그것은 간단하게 들렸다. 네 발로 바닥에 엎드려서, 그리고 짜낸다.
<br><br>
<<He_ nun>> <<his_ yi>> 컴퓨터로 몸을 돌린다. "이런 생물종들은 과학적 연구 대상이란다," <<he_ ga>> 계속 말한다. "만약 네가 돈을 좀 버는 데 관심이 있다면, 그것들을 필요로 할 지역 업체를 대신해서 내가 그것들을 살 수도 있단다." <<He_ nun>> <<his_ yi>> 발로 일어선다. "다른 궁금한 점은?"
<br><br>
당신은 머리를 젓는다. <<He_ nun>> 당신을 위해 문을 잡아 열고, 당신은 진찰실을 나간다. "건강하거라," 당신이 지나가자 <<he_ ga>> 말한다.

하퍼 선생님은 <<his_ yi>> 진찰실 문으로 걸어가, 문을 잠근다. <<He_ nun>> 등을 대고 앉는다. "오늘은 무엇을 가지고 왔니?" <<he_ ga>> 묻는다.
<br><br>
당신은 <<he_ ga>> 당신에게 주었던 작은 상자를 꺼낸다. <<He_ nun>> 안을 쳐다본다. 만족한 듯이, <<he_ nun>> <<his_ yi>> 책상 아래에서 다른, 더 큰 상자를 꺼낸다. <<He_ nun>> 그 내용물을 옮기고 빈 상자를 당신 손에 돌려준다. <<He_ nun>> 서랍을 열고, <<moneyGain $container.portable.value>>를 센다. <<He_ nun>> 그것을 당신의 손에 쥐어준다.

"지역 사회는 고마워할 거다," <<he_ ga>> 말한다.

"신기하군," <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "아-아무것도 불안해 할 필요는 없단다." <<He_ nun>> <<his_ yi>> 의자를 <<his_ yi>> 컴퓨터로 밀고 무언가를 입력한다.
<br><br>
당신은 <<he_ ga>> 화면을 읽고, 가끔 키보드를 치는 동안 기다린다. <<He_ nun>> 서랍에서 커다란 책을 꺼내, 먼지를 불어 날리고, 페이지를 넘긴다. 드디어, <<he_ nun>> 책을 밀어놓고 돌아 당신을 바라본다.
<br><br>
"네 복부에는 기생충이 있는데," <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "드문 종류야. 그건 두 생식기를 다 가지고 있고, 그 자신과 교미가 가능하단다. 그걸 꺼내기 위해서는 수술이 필요하겠구나. 그걸 빼낼 때 까지는, 너는 계속 그것의 새끼들을 낳게 될 거란다."

"옷을 벗고 수술대에 눕거라," 라텍스 장갑을 끼면서 <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "부끄러워 할 필요는 없어." <<He_ nun>> 뒤로 돌아 서랍을 뒤진다.
<br><br>

당신은 <<his_ yi>> 등이 돌아 있는 동안 <<nervously>> 당신의 옷을 벗는다. 당신은 수술대에 누워, 당신의 <<lewdness_ rul>> 의식한다. <<His_ yi>> 얼굴은 무표정인 채로, 의사는 당신의 다리를 잡아 당신의 어깨에 밀고, 끈으로 묶는다.
<br><br>

"네가 가만히 있으면 일이 쉬워질 거란다," <<he_ ga>> 당신의 손목을 묶으며 <<he_ nun>> 단언한다. 당신은 거의 움직일 수가 없다.
<br><br>

<<if _anusFuta && playerChastity("anus")>>
	<<He_ nun>> 당신의 <<worn_under_lower_name_ ul>> 조사하더니, 이상한 금속 기기를 <<his_ yi>> 코트에서 꺼낸다. <<He_ ga>> 그 금속으로 톡톡 치니까, 당신의 애널 보호대가 떨어진다. "끝나면 다시 돌려놓을 거란다," <<he_ ga>> 말한다.
	<br><br>
<</if>>

<<He_ nun>> 다른 서랍을 열고, 동그란 구슬이 끝에 달린 매끈한 하얀 막대를 꺼낸다. <<He_ nun>> 그것의 얇은 끝을 당신의 <<bottomPost>>에 밀어넣는다. "그냥 긴장을 풀고 있거라,<<if playerBellyVisible() and !_vaginaFuta>> 이건 아기를 해치지 않으니까,<</if>>" <<he_ ga>> 말한다. 그것은 마치 윤활제가 발린 듯이, 아픔 없이 미끄러져 들어온다. 하퍼가 반대쪽 끝을 이리저리 비틀자, 당신은 당신 안에서 그것이 고동치는 것을 느낀다.
<<garousal>><<arousal 1200 "bottom">>
<br><br>

그 고동의 세기가 점점 세지는 동안 하퍼는 눈도 깜박이지 않고 당신의 <<bottom_ ul>> 주시한다. 당신이 더 이상 참을 수 없다고 느끼려는 찰나, <<he_ ga>> 그것을 빼낸다. 그 <<if $pregnancyStats.namesParasitesChild is true>>아기 <</if>>기생충은<<if _analFutaOther or _vaginaFutaOther>> 더 작은 녀석과 함께<</if>> 그 끝에 감겨 있다. <<He_ nun>> 그것을 불투명한 상자 안에 넣고, 상자를 꽉 닫는다.
<<if _vaginaFuta and _anusFuta>>
	<<He_ nun>> 그 작업을 당신 안의 다른 쪽의 기생충들에게도 반복했고 더 많은 기생충들이 상자에 담겨 봉해진다.
<</if>>
<br><br>

"다 됐다," <<he_ ga>> 끈을 풀며 말한다. <<He_ nun>> 당신이 옷을 다시 입을 동안 뒤로 몸을 돌린다.
