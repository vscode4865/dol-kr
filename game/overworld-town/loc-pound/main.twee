<br><br>

The staff soon arrive, irritated at their nights being disturbed. That's nothing compared to their anger at hearing what you've done. One <<person5>><<person>> marches to the <<beasttype 0>>'s cage. "No no no," <<he>> says. "We are so fucked." <<He>> looks at you. "You little shit."
<br><br>

They demand that the police hit you with the fullest extent of the law. The whole book. Until they notice one of their number, a <<person6>><<person>>, grinning at you in silence.
<br><br>
"Calm down everyone," <<he>> says. "We have a replacement." The others follow <<his>> gaze, and their anger fades. "Thank you officers. We won't press charges."
