You didn't even know this cabinet existed. It doesn't particularly stand out from the rest of the cabinets in the arcade. Someone else wouldn't have given this a second glance.
<br><br>

A jet-black tint covers the cabinet. You can tell the cabinet isn't new, but it seems oddly pristine as well. Almost as if it was just put into place a week ago. Now that it's piqued your interest, you can't help but feel drawn to it.

	With a coin in your hand, you look for a slot, but you can't seem to find one.
	<br><br>

	The screen suddenly flashes to life, almost blinding you with its incandescent glow. In the centre of the screen, you see the word <span class = "purple">"Tenyclus"</span> bolded with a unique font. A copyright in smaller text is seen below.

	<span class = "purple">"1982, Lüsterngrad"</span>

	Three words light up shortly after. <i>"Press to Start"</i>

	You start to play the game. It's pretty fun for the most part, if not a bit basic. You wonder why you haven't seen anyone else play on this cabinet.
	<br><br>

	The graphics are so primitive, you're not really sure who or what you're playing as. All you can make out is that it looks like you're fighting off something. Your best guess is aliens, but it could really be anything.

You walk out from the table. <<He>> approaches you and kneels down in front of you.
<br><br>

<<He>> gets to work on your <<genitals>> like <<hes>> done it a million times before. It's not long before you're sweating and moaning. The whole crowd has their phones out, capturing everything.
<br><br>

You feel a heat rising as <<he>> works and you know you're about to explode soon.<<set $penisuse to "othermouth">><<orgasm>>

You shudder as <<he>> finishes you off. "Thanks for a fun time," <<he>> says. "I hope we can play again sometime." You watch as <<he>> grabs <<his>> clothes and dresses <<himself>>. <<He>> walks off casually.

	<br><br>

	"Fair enough," <<he>> says. "I live close-by, I can handle a revealing walk home."
	<br><br>

	<<He>> turns on <<his>> heels and walks towards the entrance. The crowd watches and records <<him>>, but <<he>> makes no effort to cover <<himself>>. You watch <<him>> casually walk out the front door into public.
<<else>>
	"No, I'm not going to do that," you say.
	<br><br>

	"Suit yourself," <<he>> says. Without another word <<he>> grabs your clothes and tosses them, one by one, into the crowd. You watch in horror as the audience grabs them and keeps them like trophies.
	<br><br>

	"You're welcome to stick around," <<he>> says. "But you're making a nice spectacle of yourself."
	<br><br>

	You're standing naked in the middle of the arcade. The whole crowd is staring at you, their phones pointed at you.
	<br><br>

	You run off into the arcade, everyone watching your rear as you leave. You take cover behind a game machine in a corner of the arcade.

	<br><br>

	The crowd seems to be disappointed, like their show was ruined. People start to filter off into the arcade. <<He>> fixes <<his>> clothing and throws yours on top of you.
	<br><br>

	"Thanks for ruining a good time," <<he>> says, before walking off. You dress yourself and move on, bruised and embarrassed.

	The crowd is looking upset and angry. You quickly grab your clothes and run off into the arcade. You find a quiet corner before dressing yourself.
