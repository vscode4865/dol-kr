"이 방은 사원에서 가장 잘 지켜지고 있는 비밀 중 하나야," 시드니가 속삭인다. "다른 어느 곳보다 천국에 가깝다는 기도실이래. 이곳에서 하는 기도는 격렬해지는 경향이 있어서, 완전히 방음 처리되어 있어. 밖에 있는 사람들을 위해서."

조던이 <<his_>>의 로브에서 종을 꺼내어, 네 번 울린다. 시드니는 얼른 <<person1>><<his_>>의 양 손으로 드러난 <<his_>>의 부위를 숨기려 한다. 잠시 후, 네 명의 <<person2>><<monks_ 가>> 방으로 들어온다. 그들 중 두 명은 회색 가루가 담긴 투명한 항아리를 들고 있고, 나머지 두 명은 다양한 쿠션과 이불, 양초들을 가져 온다. 그들은 테이블 위에 그것들을 올려놓기 시작하고, 양초에 불이 켜진다. 방의 다른 모든 조명들이 어두워지는 것 같다.
<br><br>
"제단에 누워 주세요," 조던이 당신의 어깨에 손을 얹으며 말한다. 당신이 그 말에 따라 등을 대고 눕자, 이불들이 그 아래의 차가운 재질로부터 당신을 보호해준다. <<monks_ 가>> 나지막하게 뭔가를 말하기 시작하지만, 당신은 무슨 말인지 알아들을 수 없다. "시드니 <<nnpc_Brother_ 여 "Sydney">>. 사랑하는 사람과 함께 제단에 오르십시오. <<pher_>>의 손을 잡고, 얼굴을 마주 보세요." 시드니는 망설이지만, 순순히 따른다.
<br><br>
<<person1>><<He_ 는>> 당신의 위로 올라와, <<his_>>의 손으로 당신의 손을 잡는다. 서로의 노출을 애써 무시하려 애쓰며, 둘 다 눈을 마주치고 있는 동안 <<His_>>의 얼굴은 점점 더 새빨개진다. <<takeHandholdingVirginity "Sydney" `($sydneyromance is 1?"romantic":"consensual")`>>
<br><br>
조던이 걸음을 옮겨 제단 밑에 있는 무언가를 건드리자, 상아로 된 족쇄 세트가 나타나, 당신과 시드니의 손을 같이 결박한다. "그들이 하나로 묶이기를 바라므로, 우리도 그들을 묶습니다."
<br>
<<person2>><<monks_ 가>> 조던의 말을 반복한다. "우리도 그들을 묶습니다."

"이 면죄, 이 약속, 이 서약이 굳건히 유지되기를, 영원히, 하나로."
<br>
"영원히, 하나로."
<br><br>
 <<person2>><<monks_>> 중 한 사람이 양초 하나를 집어, 시드니를 향해 들어 올린다. "당신의 사랑이 순수하다면, 당신은 고통을 느끼지 않을 겁니다." 둘 다 서로의 호흡이 점점 가빠지는 것을 느끼고, 시드니의 맨살이 당신의 몸에 밀착되면서 당신의 안쪽에서 점점 열이 피어오르기 시작한다. <<arousal 100>><<garousal>>
<br><br>
당신은 시드니 위의 양초가 빠른 속도로 녹는 것을 본다. 촛농 한 방울이 <<person1>><<his_>>의 맨 등에 떨어진다. <<He_ 는>> 움찔하지만, 곧 안도하는 표정을 짓는다. 더 많은 촛농이 떨어지기 시작해, 시드니에게서 당신에게로 떨어지기 시작한다. 매우 뜨겁지만, <span class="gold">아픔은 느껴지지 않는다.</span>

촛농이 계속해서 흘러내리면서, 당신의 몸에서 빠르게 미끄러져 제단으로 떨어진다. <<person2>><<monks_>> 중 한 명이 빈 단지에 촛농을 모으기 시작한다. "풀어 주도록." 결박이 풀리면서, 당신은 자유로워진다. <<monks_ 가>> 두 사람을 일으켜, 제단의 가장자리에 앉을 수 있도록 도와준다.
<br><br>
"의식은 끝났지만," 조던이 말한다, "마지막 단계가 하나 남아 있습니다. 우리는 여러분의 새로운 순결 시험을 준비해야 해요." 한 <<monk_ 가>> 회색 가루가 든 항아리를 들고 당신에게 다가온다. <<He_ 는>> 항아리를 열고, 그것을 당신의 <<genitals_>>에 문지르기 시작한다. 당신은 고개를 돌려, 시드니가 또 다른 <<monk_>>에게 같은 처치를 받는 것을 본다. 잠시 후, 그들은 가루를 긁어모아 녹은 촛농이 든 단지에 넣는다. 그것은 반짝이기 시작한다.
<br><br>
"이 가루는 지금부터 여러분의 시험에 사용될 것입니다," 조던이 설명하는 동안 또 다른 <<monk_ 가>> <<him_>>에게 작은 상자 하나를 건넨다. <<He_ 가>> 그것을 열자, 은반지 두 개가 나온다. <<He_ 는>> 당신의 약지에 하나를, 시드니의 약지에 나머지 하나를 조심스럽게 끼워준다.
<br><br>
"두 사람은 결속되었습니다. 다시 한번 축하합니다." 당신은 두 <<monks_ 가>> 당신의 옷을 개어서, 제단에 올려놓는 것을 알아챈다. "저희는 두 분에게 약간의... 프라이버시를 제공할 것이고, 다 끝나면 치워드리겠습니다. 쿠션과 이불들은 이 장소로부터 어떤 불순함도 남기지 않도록 불에 태워질 것입니다. 지금부터 여러분이 행할 것은, 규칙에 위배되지 않을 겁니다." 조던은 두 사람에 온화한 미소를 지어 보이고, 다른 <<monks_ 와>> 함께 떠난다. "이 결정으로 두 사람 모두 행복을 찾기를."
<br><br>
문이 잠기는 소리가 들리고, 당신은 시드니와 단둘이 남겨진다. "그...그럼, 이제 그냥...?" 시드니는 여전히 당신의 몸에서 <<person1>><<his_>>의 눈을 피하려 애쓰며, 당신을 바라본다.

<<generate2>><<person2>><<generate3>><<generate4>> A <<priest>> emerges from a door marked with a red cross. <<Hes>> flanked by many <<monks>>. One of them assures Jordan that you'll both be treated gently.
<br><br>
Head bowed, Jordan leaves the room as the <<priest>> pulls a gag from <<his>> habit. "To make amends, you must <<if $templePromised is "Sydney">>prove your bond with each other remains strong.<<else>>rely on each other, as you've both sinned.<</if>> Stay still."

	You hold on to Sydney, not daring to let go. You hold on for dear life. Whatever's coming, you know you'll be able to handle it together. <<nnpc_He "Sydney">> smiles through <<his>> panic.
	<br><br>
	The <<priest>> nods in approval. "A good start."
<<else>>
	You lash out, pushing Sydney away. It's all <<nnpc_his "Sydney">> fault, why should you be punished for this? You can handle yourself. <<nnpc_He "Sydney">> looks to you with tears in <<nnpc_his "Sydney">> eyes, looking utterly betrayed.
	<br><br>
	The <<priest>> shakes <<his>> head. "Miserable. Refusing to take responsibility. Your punishment can't come sooner."
<</if>>
<<He>> pushes the gag into your mouth and ties it firm behind your head. <<He>> walks over to Sydney and does the same motion. Any sound you make will be muffled and unintelligible. A <<person2>><<monk>> to <<his>> side wraps a collar around your neck along with Sydney's. <<He>> holds the attached leashes, and tugs.
<br><br>
You're both led through the marked door and down a cramped passage. There are no lights bar the occasional torch on the wall.
After a few minutes, you emerge in a small round room with no windows. Various incense burners hang from the ceiling, and the room is bare save for some padding in the centre, and <span class="red">whips, belts and other disciplinary devices that adorn the walls.</span>

The <<monks>> strip you and Sydney bare, leaving only your gags and collars.
You're led to the padding and forced down onto your knees. The <<priest>> pulls out some belts and grabs ahold of your arms. Your arms are wrapped around Sydney's waist, and your wrists are bound behind <<person1>><<him>>. Sydney's arms are restrained similarly. The <<person2>><<priest>> acquires more belts and wraps them around you and Sydney's waists, pressing the two of you together. One more belt wraps around both of your backs, leaving little wriggle room. Finally, a pair of shackles bind your legs together.
<br><br>
"<<if $templePromised is "Sydney">>You have broken your promise to one another,<<else>>The both of you have succumbed to pleasure and desire with one another,<</if>>" the <<priest>> speaks, brandishing a whip with nine chords hanging from the cudgel. "Given your special bond, you'll experience pain with one another as the first step to make amends." You can feel Sydney's heart race. You're overcome with fear yourself at what's coming<<if $masochism_level gte 1>>, along with a hint of excitement<</if>>.
<br><br>
The whip strikes down onto your back first without warning, stinging tremendously. Another strike causes you to thrash in pain. You let out a scream into your gag while tears fill your eyes. You can feel Sydney's panicked breathing at your pain. <<person1>><<He>> lets out a garbled protest at the torment you're receiving. Another strike comes down onto your back, stinging your flesh from the heavy chords. <<violence_noncombat 40 0.3>><<gggpain>>
<br><br>
The <<person2>><<priest>> moves over to Sydney and, without hesitation, lashes the whip onto <<person1>><<his>> back. <<He>> squeals into <<his>> gag and then receives another strike. The whip strikes Sydney's back a third time, leaving <<him>> in tears. <<stress 12>><<ggstress>>

<<else>>
	You tightly shut your eyes, trying to ignore Sydney's cries. After a few moments, you can't help but peek.
<</if>>
<br><br>
You see the <<person2>><<priest>> come into view. "Your bonds must be strong. Stronger than any desire and stronger than pain itself," <<he>> says in an instructive manner. Despite Sydney's sobs, you think the words have emboldened <<person1>><<him>>. Sydney clings onto you tighter, and you do the same around <<him>>. <span class="blue">You'll only get through this together.</span>
<br><br>
You receive more lashings on your back and then on your <<bottom>>. Sydney receives the same amount of lashes in return. After what feels like an eternity, the <<person2>><<priest>> holsters the whip. <<gpain>>
<br><br>
"Your atonement has only just begun. Ready yourselves." <<person2>><<His>> voice suddenly sounds muffled. You look over to see the <<priest>> and <<monks>> all donning strange masks, as they begin to light the incense burners. You start to feel a warmth building within you, and <span class="lewd">something inside the waist belts begins to vibrate.</span>

"You have endured much suffering, and although you failed time and time again, you've shown your bond to be strong enough to last. <span class="green">You are pure once more.</span>" Your bindings are all released.
