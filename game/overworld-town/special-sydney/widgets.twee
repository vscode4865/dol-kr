<<person2>>The <<priest>> holds up <<his>> hand. "Cease." The <<monks>> stop, and snuff the incense burners. "Your bodies betray you. You will be given time to recover, and then we will begin again." <<stress 24>><<gggstress>>
<br><br>
The <<monks>> dim the light in the room, and leave one by one. As the last one leaves, you and Sydney are left in total darkness.

You can feel Sydney's breath on your skin. Something about knowing <<nnpc_hes "Sydney">> still there calms you. <<nnpc_He "Sydney">> holds you tighter. You squeeze back. <<stress -1>><<lstress>>
