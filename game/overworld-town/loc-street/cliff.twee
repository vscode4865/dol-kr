	The cafe is currently being renovated, and the site is covered in construction workers.

<<else>>

	The cafe is full, with a line reaching out the door.

People are going about their business, to and from the beach.

The note said to start at the cafe, but you need to find somewhere to put your clothes. There's a trashcan placed right next to the cafe entrance.

You take off your clothes, getting naked in public in front of countless people. You bunch up your clothes and quickly shove them behind the trashcan.
<br><br>

The commotion starts immediately. You hear gasps and shouts and cheers from the people surrounding you.<<if hasSexStat("exhibitionism", 3)>><<garousal>><<arousal 600>><<else>><<gstress>><<stress 6>><</if>>

	Behind you, jeers are coming from the construction workers. You turn around and see that work has stopped, and all the workers are leering at your naked body.
<<else>>
	You turn and see that the entire cafe is staring at you, including a shocked-looking Sam. Several customers have gotten closer to the window to get a better look at your naked body.
<</if>>

You turn and take off, running down the street away from the cafe.
<br><br>

The seawall is to your left.
You pass by numerous people in swimsuits and summer clothes on their way to the beach. Most of them stop and gawk at you. Your running slows, as you have to manoeuvre between several people on the crowded sidewalks.
<br><br>

The air blows on your bare skin. You can feel it flowing between your legs, over your completely exposed <<genitals>> and bare ass.
<br><br>

You leave the beach wall behind and are soon surrounded by people in suits and business wear. You are running naked outside the civic centre, with the city hall on your right.

People continue to shout and jeer at you. You have to run in between large crowds of public servants.<<if hasSexStat("exhibitionism", 3)>><<garousal>><<arousal 600>><<else>><<gstress>><<stress 6>><</if>>

You pass city hall and turn right onto High Street. This part of town is even more crowded.

You pass by customers and drivers and store fronts and restaurants. Everyone on the street gets a good look at your naked run. Many are able to take out their phones and grab footage of your streak.<<if hasSexStat("exhibitionism", 3)>><<garousal>><<arousal 600>><<else>><<ggstress>><<stress 12>><</if>>

You pass by the storefront and the office building, the most crowded part of High street.
<br><br>

The noise is deafening as people shout and cars honk at you. It becomes difficult to weave through people as you make your way down the sidewalk. You're only halfway through your run.<<if hasSexStat("exhibitionism", 3)>><<garousal>><<arousal 600>><<else>><<ggstress>><<stress 12>><</if>>

You reach the alley and take another right. The alley provides some brief privacy after the crowds on High Street.
<br><br>

You pass through quickly and take a final right back onto Cliff Street.
It's less crowded here, but there are still plenty of people and cars passing by to see your fully-exposed body. The cafe is straight ahead.
<br><br>

You run as fast as you can. You sprint across the crosswalk, forcing several cars to screech to a halt. You finish your streak as you return to the cafe.
<br><br>

Miraculously, your clothes are still there. You get dressed as quickly as you can.
<br><br>

Several people clap and cheer as you put your clothes on. You catch your breath as another box floats onto the sidewalk in front of you. There's <<moneyGain 1000>> and another note inside.
<br><br>

<i>You're truly someone we can work with. Will be in contact again soon.</i>
<br><br>

You hear a buzzing above you. Looking up, there's a small drone hovering above the street. The drone has a camera lens pointed directly at you. As soon as you notice it, it flies away.<<if hasSexStat("exhibitionism", 3)>><<garousal>><<arousal 600>><<else>><<ggstress>><<stress 12>><</if>>

You shudder and pocket the money.

"No drugs," says the <<person2>><<person>>. "<<pShe>> must have ditched them somewhere."

"<<pShe>> was trying to let the other one out," the <<person3>><<person>> says. "So I guess <<pshe>> wants to swap places?"

"Is that right?" the <<person2>><<person>> asks you. "You wanna free this scumbag, and serve the rest of <<person1>><<his>> sentence? I'm happy to sub you in here, but it could get rough.
Due process would be to wrap a towel around you and get you to the station. You wait a while, go to court, have some judge get all wet-eyed about systemic injustice
