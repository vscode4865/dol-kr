문 아래로 새어나오는 빛도 없고, 안에서 작은 소리조차 들리지 않는다.
<br><br>

로빈은 원래 이렇게 이른 시간에 잠자리에 들지 않는다. 당신에게 깊은 공포감이 찾아온다.<<stress 2>><<gstress>>
<br><br>

걱정에 못 이겨, 당신은 소리 나지 않게 천천히 문의 손잡이를 돌려 문을 연다. 안을 들여다보자 침대 커버 안에 덩어리로 보이는 물체가 있다.
당신은 그 아래에서 로빈이 조용히 흐느끼는 소리를 듣는다.
<br><br>

로빈은 그동안 쭉 <<his_ yi>> 방에서 나오지 않았고, 당신과 이야기를 나누러 오지도 않았다. <<hePost>>에겐 대화할 상대가 필요할지도 모른다.

당신은 로빈의 방 문을 밀어서 연다. 삐걱이는 소리와 함께 문이 열리고, 복도의 불빛이 들어 와 <<his_ yi>> 방 어둠을 씻어낸다.
당신이 방에 들어서자 로빈이 겁에 질려 헐떡이는 숨소리를 내며, <<his_ yi>> 위로 이불을 꽉 당겨 숨는다.
<br>
방 안이 섬뜩한 침묵으로 가득 찬 가운데 당신이 로빈의 이름을 부른다.
<br>
몇 초 간, 아무 일도 일어나지 않고, 방 안은 계속 불안한 분위기로 일렁인다. 이윽고 이불 밑에서 로빈의 머리가 빠져 나온다.
<<He_ nun>> 밝은 빛에 움찔하며, 당신을 잠시 응시한다. <<He_ nun>> 당신을 확인하고는 다시 침대 커버 밑으로 숨어 든다.
<br><br>

당신은 등 뒤에 있는 문을 닫아, 다시 방을 칠흑과 같은 어두움 속으로 되돌린다. 당신은 어떻게든 로빈의 침대 곁으로 가서 그 옆에 무릎을 꿇고 앉는다.
<br><br>

이번에는 좀 더 조용히, 다시 한 번 당신이 로빈이 이름을 부른다. 당신이 전등에 손을 뻗어 만지자 불이 깜박이며 켜져, 따뜻한 오렌지 빛이 방을 감싼다.
당신은 <<he_ ga>> 스스로 밖으로 나올 때까지, <<his_ yi>> 옆에 앉아 고요하고 차분히 기다린다.
<br><br>

<<his_ yi>> 눈은 부어 있고, 눈물 때문에 충혈되어 있다. 눈물이 <<his_ yi>> 얼굴을 타고 흘러내린다. 당신은 <<hePost>>에게서 뿜어져 나오는 괴로움을 느낀다. 당신은 <<hePost>>에게 기분이 어떤지 묻는다.

	"훠-훨씬 나아," <<he_ ga>> 코를 훌쩍이면서 대답한다. "진통제도 잘 들고 있고, 그-그리고 멍도 붓기도 사라지고 있어."
<</if>>
<br><br>

둘은 이후로 몇 시간 동안 출시 될 최신 비디오 게임이나 학교의 일 같은, 떠오르는 모든 것에 대해 이야기하며 시간을 보낸다.
로빈이 <<his_ yi>> 상태와 <<himselfPost>>에 대해 이야기할 때 괴로워하긴 하지만, 당신이 <<he_ wa>> 함께 쇼핑하고 싶다고 말 할 때마다 <<he_ nun>> 기운을 차리는 것 같다.

<br><br>

"너 바쁜 거 알아. 나 이 이상 네 시간을 뺏고 싶지 않아," <<he_ nun>> 말하지만, 마지 못해 하는 듯 한 목소리다. 로빈은 하고 싶은 말이 더 많아 보인다.
<br><br>

로빈의 얼굴이 약간 붉어진다. 당신은 왜 그러느냐고 물어본다.
<br>
"아무 것도 아냐, 그냥..."
<br>
부끄러움이 로빈의 목소리를 채우고, <<he_ ga>> 적당한 단어를 찾으려 고군분투하며 말을 더듬게 만든다. 
<br><br>

"내가 하는게 무리한 부탁이 아니라면, 나랑 같이 있어 줄 수 있어? 오늘 밤, 여기서? 가끔씩 잠을 자기 힘들어," <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "너랑 같이 있으면 안전하게 느껴져."

당신은 확신하지 못하면서도, 문 쪽으로 향한다.

로빈이 당신을 보며 다정하게 미소 짓는다. 해가 완전히 저물고 별들이 밤하늘을 밝힐 때까지, 둘은 이야기를 계속 이어간다.

	<br><br>

	Your behaviour unnerves Robin, but <<he>> listens silently. You complain about everything that's been tormenting you. Robin attempts to comfort you through it all.

		Robin nods in understanding, but the tears still flow. <<He>> rises from the couch and sits next to you. You feel Robin embrace you. You return the gesture.
		<br><br>

You desperately call out Robin's name again as you enter the deepest parts of the landfill. Your voice gets hoarse.

Out of the silence, you can hear faint but distinctly human sounds, almost as if pained. You pick up the pace as you rush towards the source.
Then, turning a corner, you see a <<personsimple>>, bound by <<his>> hands and legs to a thin metal pole in the centre of the clearing.
<span class="green">It's Robin.</span> <<Hes>> been stripped naked and blindfolded, and you can see dirt and sweat coating <<his>> body.
<<His>> wrists are raw where the ropes bind them to the pole.
Some sort of device has been strapped over <<his>> mouth and nose, with a small canister attached on the side.
<br><br>

You remove the blindfold. <<His>> eyes flutter open and closed.

	"Robin! Are you alright?" you ask. "I'll get you down." You unhook the device and let it drop to the ground.
<</if>>
<br><br>

The device lets out a steady stream of pink mist, and Robin starts to cough violently.
You untie <<him>>, then lower <<him>> down on the ground as gently as you can while <<he>> coughs.
<<His>> skin is uncomfortably warm to the touch.
<br><br>

Robin sits on <<his>> knees for a few moments and gradually stops coughing. You lay a gentle hand on <<his>> back.
<<He>> turns <<his>> head and looks at you, <<his>> pupils heavily dilated and <<his>> face flushed.

You open the door and take a look inside.

At first you don't notice anything out of the ordinary. You nearly close the door, when you overhear a faint moan coming from under Robin's covers. The cover isn't lying still, it's moving from side to side as if Robin is tossing and turning.
<br><br>

You're about to enter when the cover slides down, <<npcRevealText $NPCList[0] "lower" "name">>. <<His>> naked rear and <<npcGenitals>> are on full display. Seemingly unaware of your presence, <<he>> reaches down and pleasures <<himself>> in front of your eyes. <<He>> rubs <<his>> <<personpenis>> with one hand while groping <<his>> $NPCList[0].breastdesc with the other. <<He>> bites into <<his>> pillow to muffle <<his>> moans, though you can still faintly hear them.
